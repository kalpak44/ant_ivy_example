# Apache Ivy ™ - simple example

## Requirements:

 * Ivy doesn't require much of Ant and should run correctly on pretty old versions. But it is recommended to use at least Ant 1.6 (check existing commons-codecm lib).


## How to use

execute command 

```bash
ant
```
* download & setup ivy 
*  generate simple project with dependencies
*  resolve dependencies from maven and your nexus server dependencies (ivy.xml)
*  exclude source and javadoc jars
